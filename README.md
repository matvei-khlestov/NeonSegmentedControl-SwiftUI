## Overview

A **SwiftUI** demo project showcasing a set of custom UI components with a strong focus on visual polish, precise layout control, and native interactions.

The core component of the project is a **Neon Segmented Control** featuring smooth selection animations, soft neon glow, and a layered glass-like visual composition.  
The component is integrated into a dashboard with a grid and native Drag & Drop reordering.

## Technical Stack

- Swift / SwiftUI
- Geometry-driven layout calculations
- Custom segmented control implementation
- Spring-based animations with tuned parameters
- Layered visual effects (gradients, blur, overlays)
- Centralized styling system (Colors / Styles / Metrics)
- Native Drag & Drop APIs

## Demo

The visuals above demonstrate:
- Animated interactions with the segmented control
- Dashboard layout composition and grid behavior
- Drag & Drop interactions within the grid
